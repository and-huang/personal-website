            <h2>About me:</h2>
        </u>
        <p>Hi, my name is Andrew and I am currently a computer science student at the University of Virginia. I'm a
            passionate and dedicated software developer with an interest in full stack development and data analysis.
            Please check out my GitHub page to see what I've been working on!
            <br>
            <br>I
            enjoy taking on new challenges and working with others to build
            innovative solutions.

            Outside of coding, you'll find me hiking, making music, or playing basketball.

            Let's build something amazing together!
        </p>

                <p><b><i>Research Assistant (Sep. 2023 - Dec. 2023)</i></b></p>
                <p>
                    I created educational webpages and wrote papers explaining completeness and soundness proofs for
                    cryptographic algorithms and zero-knowledge.

                <p><b><i>Intern (Jun. 2023 - Aug. 2023)</i></b></p>
                <p>I worked on a team developing 3D modeling and simulation software using C# and OpenGL. After meeting
                    with the customer, I discovered that they were having a hard time using the software because their
                    industrial work environment did not allow for an external computer mouse. I then decided to
                    implement the ability
                    to rotate the camera using the arrow keys, which was a satisfactory solution for the customer.

                    I also worked with another customer who was missing the information they needed to begin work on a
                    new project.
                    I solved this problem by automating data population from a SQL server and enabling the ability to
                    filter project
                    comments in an existing
                    .NET desktop app.
